<p>Next, we will migrate the previous historical product and iteration data to the project set and under the project, with the following scenario for migration.</p><br />
<h4>Option 1: Product and iteration organized by product line </h4>
<p>It is possible to migrate the entire product line and its following products and iterations into one project set and project, although you can also migrate them separately as needed.</p>
<h4>Option 2: Iteration of product-based organizations </h4>
<p>You can select multiple products and the iterations below them to migrate to a project set and project, or you can select a particular product and the iterations below it to migrate to a project set and project.</p>
<h4>Option 3: Independent iterations </h4>
<p>Several iterations can be selected to migrate to a single project set, or independently.</p>
<h4>Option 4: Iterations linked to multiple products.</h4>
<p>These iterations can be selected to fall under a new project.</p>
